# VR_COMM118S_project
A simple game that allows user to interact with a tennis ball via joysticks (Oculus Quest 2) on a 3-D table top.

Teck stack: It was built in Unity Hub, with the intended device set to Oculus Quest 2. A user is free to roam the ball with VR joysticks and upon hitting a wall, a warning text, accompanied by a change in colour on the collided wall, will be displayed. 

**A demo is available for non-VR devices, via ballCollision.app**
